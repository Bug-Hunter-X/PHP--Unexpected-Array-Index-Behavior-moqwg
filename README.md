# PHP Array Index Bug
This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in PHP related to array indexing. PHP's flexible approach to array indices can lead to unexpected results when dealing with: 
* Uninitialized array elements
* Extremely large array indices
* Negative array indices
The `bug.php` file contains code exhibiting these issues. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a more robust solution.
